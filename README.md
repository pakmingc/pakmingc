# Philip Cheung

**AI Engineer | Quantitative Developer | Technical Architect**

MSc Computer Science with Artificial Intelligence (Merit) from University of Wolverhampton. 10+ years building production systems spanning AI/ML, quantitative trading, and full-stack SaaS platforms.

I bridge cutting-edge AI research with practical business applications - from LLM-powered chatbots to low-latency trading infrastructure.

---

## What I Build

- **AI/ML Systems** - RAG architectures, transformer models, NLP pipelines, real-time ML inference (<100ms latency)
- **Quantitative Trading** - HFT systems, backtesting frameworks, multi-signal models, market microstructure analytics
- **Full-Stack SaaS** - Multi-tenant platforms with subscription billing, usage analytics, and enterprise integrations
- **Blockchain/Web3** - Smart contracts (Solidity), NFT marketplaces, DeFi analytics, crypto trading bots

---

## Current Focus

- **LLM-Augmented Trading Systems** - MSc dissertation combining transformer architectures with real-time market signals
- **Multi-Provider AI Architectures** - Building reliable LLM systems with fallback, rate limiting, and response validation
- **Low-Latency Infrastructure** - WebSocket streaming, event-driven systems, millisecond execution pipelines
