# Hi, I'm Pak Ming

**Full-Stack Engineer | AI Integration Specialist | SaaS Builder**

I build production-grade web applications with modern TypeScript/React stacks and integrate AI capabilities (LLMs, OCR, TTS) into user-facing products. My focus is on shipping reliable software that solves real problems.

---

## What I Build

- **AI-Powered SaaS Products** - Chat interfaces, content generation tools, and intelligent automation
- **Document Processing Systems** - OCR pipelines with multi-engine fallback, PDF generation, format conversion
- **Educational Platforms** - Interactive quiz systems, progress tracking, certification prep tools
- **Media Processing Tools** - Subtitle extraction, text-to-speech synthesis, translation workflows
- **Full-Stack Web Applications** - End-to-end development from React frontends to Python/Node backends

---

## Recent Engineering Themes (Last 12 Months)

Based on my commit activity across private repositories:

- **LLM Integration Architecture** - Building robust chatbot systems with multi-provider fallback, rate limiting, and response validation (including refusal detection)
- **Multi-Engine OCR Systems** - Developing OCR services that leverage multiple engines (Paddle, Tesseract) for accuracy and reliability
- **Subscription SaaS Patterns** - Implementing complete payment flows with Stripe, including checkout, webhooks, and subscription management
- **Real-Time UX Patterns** - ChatGPT-style streaming responses, optimistic updates, and responsive interfaces
- **Serverless Deployment** - AWS Lambda, SAM templates, and containerized deployments

## Private Work Note

Most of my recent work (900+ commits in the past 12 months) is in private repositories for clients and personal SaaS products. I cannot share source code due to confidentiality, but I can:

1. **Walk through architectures** in a screen-share interview
2. **Discuss technical decisions** with anonymized examples
3. **Show my contribution graph** as evidence of consistent activity
4. **Demonstrate deployed products** (where permitted)

---

## How I Work

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode for type safety
- ESLint + Prettier for consistent formatting
- Modular architecture with clear separation of concerns

### Testing
- Unit tests for business logic (pytest, Jest)
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests with Playwright for critical flows

### Deployment
- Docker containers for consistent environments
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment
- Environment-based configuration management

### Security
- Input validation at system boundaries
- Secrets management (environment variables, not hardcoded)
- Authentication with established providers (Supabase, Firebase)

## Contact & Interview Walkthrough

I'm happy to do a technical deep-dive on any of my work. In a screen-share session, I can:

- Walk through system architectures with redacted diagrams
- Explain technical decisions and trade-offs
- Discuss challenges faced and how I solved them
- Show code patterns (without revealing proprietary logic)
